## Welcome to my ePortfolio

Here I will include all of the artifacts for the CS 499 Capstone class at Southern New Hampshire University

### Artifact Selection and Refinement Plan

#Category One, Software design and engineering: 
For this category I am using an open source program that I found on GitHub. This program is a simple game 
program that will roll a die for a given number of players. This falls into the category of software design. 
My plan for this program is the enhance it by adding a leaderboard system in the form of a database that 
takes in the game results and stores them in a place that they can be accessed later. I think that making 
this improvement demonstrates the course outcome of using well-founded and innovative techniques. I believe 
that this will elevate this simple game into something that can be more advanced than just rolling a die 
over and over. Now it will be more like a game with the leaderboard system. There can also be even more 
added on later now that there is a leaderboard such as new games or incentives based on leaderboard position.

#Category Two, Algorithms and data structures:
For this category I am using an open source calculator program that I found on GitHub. This program in 
just a simple calculator that has add, subtract, multiply and mod functions. I plan to add new algorithms 
to the program that can perform more advanced math problems such as trig functions. I will also add in a 
new menu that is easier to use and showcases all the capabilities of the calculator. I believe this showcases 
my knowledge of using algorithmic principles to improve upon the quality of the work and to also increase 
the efficiency to make it a more professionally acceptable program.

#Category Three, Databases:
For this category I am going to use the final project from the most recent course I took at SNHU. 
This program has api calls for a mongodb database to run through the basic function for a market stocks 
database. The improvements that I plan to make on this project is to create an interface that can help a 
user go through the functions of create, read, add and delete within the database without having to input 
the curl functions themselves. I believe this showcases my ability to implement computer solutions to 
accomplish industry specific goals. The goals here being a functioning product that the average person 
can understand and use in a professional environment.
